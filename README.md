# number_to_words
a python module that I wrote years ago (and even forgot about) to translate natural numbers into words. 

Theres probably a better module that you would want to use [Numbs2Words](https://github.com/savoirfairelinux/num2words) since it has a lot more features and support. But I wrote this one from the ground up, from the logic trying to figure out how numbers are named to the algorithm itself. So, to prevent losing it again im keeping it here.
